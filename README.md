## Algorithm implemented
1. Branch-and-Bound
2. Heuristics
3. Local Search: Genetic Algorithm
4. Local Search: Simulated Annealing Algorithm
    
## Usage:
### Branch-and-Bound
### Heuristics
### Genetic Algorithm
    Implemented in genetic.py and linked to tsp_main.py
### Simulated Algorithm
    Implemented in SA.py and linked to tsp_main.py
    Updated: 
    added cutoff functionality: cooling rate, default is 0.001. 
    added trace: In the format of [[elapsed time, best distance so far], []...], not round the time yet. 
    added best route: the list of index for each point
    *Please keep the runSA.py temporarily for my testing purpose. It can run directly and you can also see the output for each step. We can remove it before submission.
